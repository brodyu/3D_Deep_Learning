# A Survey of 3D Deep Learning Techniques for Object Classification

## Abstract
The objective of this study was to survey different deep learning techniques to analyze 3D data for object classification. Understanding 3D data is attracting attention due to its various applications from autonomous driving to medical image processing. Unlike 2D data, which has been extensively researched, traditional classification techniques on 3D data lack robustness. However, due to recent advances and lower costs, 3D data is gaining abundance and driving innovation in the 3D space. The various approaches surveyed in this study all revolve around the utilization of deep learning algorithms. These techniques are based on different 3D data representations such as multi-view RGB-D data, volumetric data, and point cloud data. This study implements a convolutional neural network on a 3D point cloud dataset of handwritten digits. The same convolutional neural network architecture is then compared to a similar 2D version of the dataset to compare accuracy results. The goals of the study are to understand the recent advancements and current state of 3D object recognition.
